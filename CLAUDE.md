### `slime_purple.tscn`
Same structure and script as `slime.tscn`, but now uses `GandalfHardcore Slime Enemy/Slime red.png`. The filename is legacy; in-game node is `SlimeEnemyRed`.

### `slime_blue.tscn`
Standalone copy of the same slime setup using `GandalfHardcore Slime Enemy/Slime blue.png`. It is intentionally not inherited from `slime.tscn`, so editor collider tweaks are less fragile.

## Scripts

### `IDamageable.cs`
Single-method interface: `void TakeDamage(int damage)`. Every entity that can be hit must implement this. Currently: `PlayerController`, `SlimeEnemy`.

### `PlayerController.cs`
State machine with states: `Idle | Move | Run | Jump | Fall | Attack | Hurt | Dead`

Key constants:
```csharp
const float Speed = 100.0f;
const float RunSpeed = 160.0f;
const float JumpVelocity = -250.0f;
const float MaxSprint = 100.0f;
const float SprintDrainPerSecond = 35.0f;
const float SprintRechargePerSecond = 25.0f;
```

Input actions:
- `ui_accept` — jump (Space/Enter)
- `ui_left` / `ui_right` / `ui_up` / `ui_down` — movement (`Input.GetVector`)
- `Shift` — sprint while held, limited by a constantly recharging sprint meter
- `attack` — attack (mapped to left mouse button)

Attack flow: `SetState(Attack)` → `"attack"` animation plays on `GandalfHardcore Warrior.png` → animation keyframe enables `AttackHitbox/CollisionShape2D` at t=0.16s and disables it at t=0.40s → `_PhysicsProcess` detects overlapping `IDamageable` bodies (one hit per swing via `_hasDealtDamageThisAttack`) → `OnAnimationFinished` returns to `Idle`.

The hitbox enable/disable is driven by **animation keyframes**, not by code — do not manually toggle it in C#.
Attack direction is driven by `UpdateFacingDirection()`, which moves `AttackHitbox.Position` to `Vector2(40, -9)` when facing right and `Vector2(-40, -9)` when facing left. The warrior sheet faces left by default, so `Sprite2D.FlipH = !_facingLeft`.

`UpdateMovementState()` transitions between `Idle / Move / Run / Jump / Fall`; it returns early when state is `Attack`, `Hurt`, or `Dead`.

`Heal(int amount)` restores player HP up to `MaxHealth`, updates the HUD `HealthBar`, and returns `true` only if health actually changed. Interactables use this to avoid consuming healing items while the player is already full HP.

Player damage cooldowns are tracked per attacker for source-aware damage. `SlimeEnemy` calls `TakeDamageFrom(this, AttackDamage)`, so each slime is rate-limited independently and two slimes attacking together can both apply damage during their own attack cycles. Generic `TakeDamage()` still uses the shared `_invincibleTimer`.

### `SlimeEnemy.cs`
State machine with states: `Patrol | Chase | Attack | Hurt | Dead`

Key exports (tunable in editor):
```csharp
int MaxHealth = 30;   int AttackDamage = 5;
float MoveSpeed = 40; float DetectRange = 120; float AttackRange = 52;
```

AI loop (runs in `_PhysicsProcess`):
1. Distance to player → if `< AttackRange`: attack; if `< DetectRange`: chase; else: patrol
2. Patrol reverses direction on wall collision or after `PatrolTime = 2.5s`
3. Attack damage is applied via `_attackDamageTimer = 0.24s` delay (mid-animation), not via a hitbox. Slimes call `PlayerController.TakeDamageFrom(this, AttackDamage)` so multiple slimes stack damage correctly.

Player is located with `GetTree().GetFirstNodeInGroup("player")` — the player must stay in group `"player"`.

On death: `QueueFree()` immediately removes the node.

### `HealthBar.cs`
Reusable `Node2D` health bar used by the player HUD and slime enemies. It supports the original `ColorRect` children (`Border`, `Background`, `Fill`) plus a textured Gandalf player HUD using `GandalfHardcore Hp bar/Hp bar.png`, `red bar.png`, and `yellow bar.png`.

`SetHealth(currentHealth, maxHealth)` clamps the HP ratio, resizes the red player HP fill or compact enemy `Fill`, switches enemy fill color by HP ratio (green → yellow → red), and hides the bar when health reaches 0. `SetSecondary(ratio)` drives the yellow sprint meter on the player HUD.

### `AppleInteractable.cs`
Attached to `main_node.tscn` → `Decor/grass-5_norm2`, which is an apple visual from `Decor.png`. It has an `InteractionArea` (`Area2D`, mask layer 2 for player) and a `PromptLabel` that says `"Press E to eat"` while the player is nearby.

Interaction uses direct `Key.E` detection with an internal just-pressed guard. On press, it calls `PlayerController.Heal(HealAmount)` and `QueueFree()` only if healing succeeds.

### `ZoneManager.cs`
Attached to the `ZoneManager` node in `main_node.tscn`. Reads player X each frame and crossfades between the three background `CanvasLayer` sets.

Key constants (adjust to change zone layout):
```csharp
const float Zone1End = 576f;   // world-x centre of zone 1→2 crossfade
const float Zone2End = 1152f;  // world-x centre of zone 2→3 crossfade
const float FadeSize = 128f;   // total crossfade width in game pixels
```

Alpha formula: `NormalBG` always stays at 1 (base layer); `AutumnBG = t12*(1-t23)`; `WinterBG = t23`. This gives a correct linear crossfade when layers are stacked (Autumn over Normal, Winter over Autumn).

### `PlayerAnimator.cs` / `PlayerAnimation.cs`
Both are empty stubs. `PlayerAnimator` is the scene container for the player's `AnimationPlayer`+`Sprite2D`. `PlayerAnimation.cs` at the repo root is unused legacy code.

## Collision Layers

| Layer | Bit | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| World | 1 | TileMap physics |
| Player | 2 | `character.tscn` CharacterBody2D |
| Enemy | 4 | `slime.tscn` CharacterBody2D |

`AttackHitbox` has `collision_mask = 4` → overlaps enemies only. No enemy has an `AttackHitbox`; SlimeEnemy uses a distance check instead.

## TileMap & Ground

- **Tileset texture**: `res://GandalfHardcore FREE Platformer Assets/Floor Tiles1.png` (288×576 px, 18×36 tiles at 16px)
- **Tile size**: 16×16 px (Godot default — do NOT set `tile_size` or `texture_region_size` explicitly in .tscn; overriding these breaks world coordinates)
- **Ground rows**: y=34 (surface) and y=35 (fill) → world_y = 544 and 560
- **World width**: 108 tiles = 1728 px
- **Physics polygon per tile**: `(-8,-8, 8,-8, 8,8, -8,8)` (full 16px tile)

### Atlas tile selection (col 0 of each zone section)

| Zone | Surface atlas | Fill atlas |
|---|---|---|
| Normal (rows 0–11) | `(0, 0)` | `(0, 8)` |
| Autumn (rows 12–23) | `(0, 12)` | `(0, 20)` |
| Winter (rows 24–35) | `(0, 24)` | `(0, 32)` |

Column 0 was chosen as a safe default. To use a different visual tile, select tiles in the Godot editor's TileMap inspector — all physics-defined tiles in col 0 already have collision, so changing to another col just changes the visual.

### Spawn positions
- **Player**: `Vector2(48, 539)` — feet land at world_y 544 (= top of ground row 34)
- **SlimeEnemy**: `Vector2(300, 544)` — feet land at world_y 544

## Zone System & Backgrounds

The world is divided into 3 horizontal zones (each 36 tiles / 576 px wide):

| Zone | X range | Background theme | Floor Tiles1.png rows |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 – Normal | 0 – 576 | Green castle forest | 0–11 |
| 2 – Autumn | 576 – 1152 | Autumn castle | 12–23 |
| 3 – Winter | 1152 – 1728 | Winter castle | 24–35 |

Each zone's background is a `CanvasLayer` (layer=−100) containing a `Sprites` Node2D with 6 `Sprite2D` children (castle image + layers 5→1). All background images are from `GandalfHardcore FREE Platformer Assets/GandalfHardcore Background layers/`. Sprites are centred at `Vector2(576, 324)` with `scale = Vector2(2, 2)` — sized for the default 1152×648 viewport.

## Assets

| File | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `GandalfHardcore Warrior.png` | `GandalfHardcore FREE Warrior/` | Active player spritesheet, 80×64 frames |
| `knight.png`, `attack.png` | `sprites/` | Legacy player spritesheets, no longer used by `character.tscn` |
| `Floor Tiles1.png` | `GandalfHardcore FREE Platformer Assets/` | Active ground tileset |
| `Slime green.png`, `Slime red.png`, `Slime blue.png` | `GandalfHardcore Slime Enemy/` | Active slime spritesheets, 32×32 frames |
| `slime_green.png`, `slime_purple.png` | `sprites/` | Legacy slime sprites, no longer used by slime scenes |
| `Decor.png` apple region | `GandalfHardcore FREE Platformer Assets/` | `grass-5_norm2` apple heal interactable |
| Background layers (×18) | `GandalfHardcore FREE Platformer Assets/GandalfHardcore Background layers/` | Zone backgrounds (Normal/Autumn/Winter, 6 layers each) |
| `world_tileset.png` | `sprites/` | No longer used (replaced by Floor Tiles1.png) |
| `coin.png`, `fruit.png` | `sprites/` | Unused — collectibles |
| `platforms.png` | `sprites/` | Unused |

Duplicate PNG copies at the repo root are legacy leftovers — scenes reference `res://sprites/…` or `res://GandalfHardcore FREE Platformer Assets/…`.

## Known Technical Notes

- **`move` animation loop**: requires `loop_mode = 1` in `character.tscn`. If the walk cycle freezes after one pass, this property is missing on the `Animation_wfnr8` sub_resource.
- **Editor cache**: Godot stores the last-selected AnimationPlayer path in `.godot/editor/*.cfg`. If the node `PlayerAnimator` was previously named `AgentAnimator`, these files contain stale paths and produce "Node not found" warnings on scene load. The cache files have been patched.
- **TileMap tile_size**: Do not set `tile_size = Vector2i(32, 32)` on the TileSet sub_resource in .tscn — Godot 4.6 may not apply it from the file, causing the tile grid to default to 16px and placing ground tiles at world_y=272 instead of 544 (off-screen).
- **CanvasLayer modulate**: `CanvasLayer` does not extend `CanvasItem` so it has no `modulate` property. The fade targets are the `Sprites` Node2D children (which do have `modulate`).
- **Health bars**: Player health is a `CanvasLayer` HUD child at screen position `(16, 16)` using the large Gandalf HP frame with a red orb/HP fill and yellow sprint meter. Enemy health bars are compact world-space children above each slime. The same `HealthBar.cs` supports both via `UseLargeFrame`.
- **Attack direction**: The player attack hitbox must be moved left/right by position, not by `Scale.X`. The sprite's visual flip is inverted because the warrior source art faces left.
- **Warrior spritesheet**: Player animations use 80×64 regions from `GandalfHardcore FREE Warrior/GandalfHardcore Warrior.png`. Current mapped rows: idle row 7, move row 8, run row 9, jump row 11, fall/hit row 12, attack row 14 (slash frames 0–5), death row 15.
